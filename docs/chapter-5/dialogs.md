# Dialogs

Dialogs are a set of predefined modal windows that are common when using an UI system, such as:
* notification (dialogs that show an error or a message)
* save/open (dialogs that allows you to select the name of a file(s) that will be saved or opened)
* folder selection (a dialog that allows you to select a folder)
* window management (a dialog that provides window management through out the entire AppCUI system)

All dialogs are available via `appcui::dialogs` module.
